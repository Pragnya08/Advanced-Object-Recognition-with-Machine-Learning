# Advanced-Object-Recognition-with-Machine-Learning

Overview:
This project explores the challenge of classifying images based on machine learning techniques. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grid, flattened into a 784-dimensional vector. The objective is to classify these images into two categories using various machine learning algorithms.

Required Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib


Contents:
- Advanced-Object-Recognition: The main Jupyter Notebook with all code and visualizations.
- Predictions.csv: Model predictions on the test dataset.

Running the Project:
- Download or clone the repository.
- Install the required libraries.
- Open and run Advanced-Object-Recognition.ipynb in a Jupyter environment.

Key Findings:
The project applies various classifiers such as k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest.
Analysis includes data visualization, performance evaluation, and dimensionality reduction via PCA.
